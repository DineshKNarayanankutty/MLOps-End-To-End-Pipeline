# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline (Iris Classification)

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a **machine learning model is built, packaged, deployed, and operated as a production service**, rather than remaining as a notebook or standalone script.

The **Iris classification problem** is used as a simple, well-known ML task so that the focus remains on **system architecture, deployment, and operations** instead of model complexity.

At a high level, this project covers:

* Training a reproducible ML model
* Tracking experiments and artifacts with MLflow
* Versioning data, models, and pipelines with DVC
* Serving predictions through a REST API
* Packaging the application using Docker
* Storing images in Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Deploying the service to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Observing runtime behavior with Prometheus and Grafana

---

## 🎯 Core Intention

The core intention of this project is to show that:

> **A trained ML model only becomes valuable when it can run reliably as a service.**

Rather than focusing on algorithm tuning, this project emphasizes the operational side of ML systems:

| Area       | What This Project Demonstrates      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Training   | Script-driven, repeatable training  |
| Tracking   | Versioned experiments and artifacts |
| Versioning | Data, models, and pipelines (DVC)   |
| Serving    | API-based access to the model       |
| Packaging  | Immutable Docker images             |
| Deployment | Kubernetes-based runtime (AKS)      |
| Operations | Health checks and metrics           |

The model is treated as **software that must be built, deployed, and operated**, not as a one-time experiment.

---

## 🌸 Why the Iris Dataset?

The Iris dataset is intentionally chosen because it is:

* Small and fast to train
* Easy to understand without deep ML knowledge
* Free from complex data engineering requirements

This allows anyone reading the project to focus on **how the system works end to end**. The same architecture can be reused for larger, real-world datasets without changing the overall design.

---

## 🧠 End-to-End Flow

```
Load Data
   ↓
Preprocess & Train (DVC Pipeline)
   ↓
Log Metrics & Model Artifact (MLflow)
   ↓
Package API with Docker
   ↓
Push Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
   ↓
Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
   ↓
Serve Predictions via REST API
   ↓
Expose Metrics → Prometheus → Grafana
```

External users interact only with the **API**, not with the training or model management components.

## 🔬 Machine Learning Details

| Aspect       | Description                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Problem Type | Multiclass classification       |
| Dataset      | Iris dataset                    |
| Library      | scikit-learn                    |
| Metrics      | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 |

The ML implementation is intentionally **simple and modular**, allowing the system architecture to remain the primary focus.

---

## 🔁 Training & Experiment Tracking

Model training is executed as a **reproducible DVC pipeline**:

```bash
dvc repro
```

During training:

* Parameters and metrics are logged to **MLflow**
* The trained model is stored as a **versioned artifact**
* Evaluation is performed as part of the training stage

This ensures results are **repeatable, traceable, and consistent across environments**.

---

## 📦 Data & Pipeline Versioning (DVC)

This project uses **DVC (Data Version Control)** to manage **datasets, models, and ML pipelines**.

While **Git** tracks source code and configuration, **DVC handles large artifacts and pipeline execution state**.

### Why DVC?

DVC ensures that:

* Data and models are versioned without bloating Git
* Pipelines are deterministic and reproducible
* Only affected stages rerun when something changes

---

### 🔁 DVC Pipeline Overview

```
data/raw
   ↓
preprocess
   ↓
train
```

Each stage explicitly defines:

* **Dependencies** (data, code, parameters)
* **Outputs** (processed data, models)

---

### 📁 Git vs DVC Responsibilities

| Component                        | Tracked By |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Source code                      | Git        |
| Configuration (`params.yaml`)    | Git        |
| Raw data                         | DVC        |
| Processed data                   | DVC        |
| Trained models                   | DVC        |
| Pipeline definition (`dvc.yaml`) | Git        |
| Pipeline state (`dvc.lock`)      | Git        |

---

### ⚙️ Reproducing the Pipeline

```bash
dvc repro
```

Artifacts can be synchronized to remote storage with:

```bash
dvc push
```

This allows the same pipeline to be reproduced on any machine.

---

### 🔗 DVC and MLflow Together

* **DVC** → pipeline reproducibility and artifact versioning
* **MLflow** → experiment tracking and metric logging

Together, they provide full **model lineage and traceability**.

---

## 🌐 Model Serving (FastAPI)

The FastAPI service exposes:

* `POST /predict` – return model predictions
* `GET /health` – service health status
* `GET /metrics` – Prometheus-compatible metrics

The model is loaded at application startup and used only for inference.

---

## 🐳 Containerization

The FastAPI application is packaged using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t mlops-api .
```

The image is pushed to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**:

```bash
docker tag mlops-api <acr-name>.azurecr.io/mlops-api:latest
docker push <acr-name>.azurecr.io/mlops-api:latest
```

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment (AKS)

The containerized application is deployed to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

Deployment flow:

```
GitHub Actions → Azure Container Registry (ACR) → AKS
```

Kubernetes manages:

* Pod lifecycle
* Restarts and scaling
* Service exposure

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

* **Prometheus** scrapes metrics from `/metrics`
* **Grafana** visualizes request rates, latency, and service health

---

## 🔄 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions automates:

1. Running tests
2. Building Docker images
3. Pushing images to ACR
4. Deploying to AKS

Every deployment uses a **tested, versioned artifact**.

---

## ▶️ Running Locally

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Automated retraining pipelines
* Advanced drift detection
* Canary or blue-green deployments
* Feature store integration
* Model explainability dashboards
